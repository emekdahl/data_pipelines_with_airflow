# Lesson One - Data Pipelines #

## What is a Data Pipeline? ##

### Real World Examples of the Output of a Data Pipeline ###

- automated marketing emails

- real-time pricing for ride-share apps

- shopping online and then later saw ads for items which you had been considering but hadn't yet purchased

### Definition - What is a data pipeline ###

- a series of steps in which data is processed

- ETL steps are often found but each step is not strictly required

## Data Validation ##

### Definition ### 

- the process of ensuring that data is present, correct & meaningful

- data quality checks can be performed manually, but it is strongly preferred that it is automated and becomes a part of pipeline definitions

### Data Validation in Action ###

- assert that the same number of rows was maintained

- validate that values that should be greater than 0 are greater than 0, as in the bikesharing app example

- ensuring that the output matches the needs of the customer

### Why is this important? ###

- data pipelines provide a set of logical guidelines and a common set of terminology

- the conceptual framework of data pipelines will help you better organize and execute everyday data engineering tasks
